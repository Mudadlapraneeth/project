# Existing System
Most traditional image viewers or editors allow users to inspect pixel colors using a color picker tool, but:

- They typically do not display named colors alongside RGB values.

- Many tools are not beginner-friendly or open-source, making them less accessible for learners.

- Some online solutions rely on internet connectivity or web APIs, limiting offline use.

- These tools generally lack customization or integration with educational content.

# Proposed System
The proposed system is a Python-based desktop application that offers:

💡 Real-time detection of RGB values when the user clicks on a pixel in an image.

🧠 Automatic matching of the detected RGB value to the closest known color name using a local dataset.

🖼️ Offline functionality, using OpenCV and NumPy for efficient image processing.

🔄 A lightweight and open-source tool suitable for educational, development, and design use cases.

🧩 Modular structure to allow for future enhancements such as HEX code conversion, color-blind friendly palettes, or image annotation tools.
