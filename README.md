RGB Color Detection Using Python
# Description
This project is a Python-based application that detects the RGB values of any pixel in an image and identifies its closest named color from a predefined dataset. Using OpenCV and NumPy, the tool reads and displays images, captures real-time mouse events, and provides precise color information on user interaction.
